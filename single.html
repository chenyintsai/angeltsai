	            <h2 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">Introduction</h2>
	            <p >Egg is a ubiquitous food source in our diet and is an easily digested protein source that provides energy to our bodies. They also possess versatile characteristics including gelation, foaming, emulsification, and binding adhesion properties. These characteristics enable us to create various kinds of products such as baked goods, puddings, meringue, meat patties, salad dressings, etc. Most recently, there have been increased concerns with foodborne illnesses caused by cross contamination from egg products because of the inappropriate sanitization of eggs. Furthermore, many people have avoided egg products due to allergens from the proteins. The high cholesterol content in egg yolk that could cause cardiovascular diseases is still of people’s concern. Most importantly, there has been a huge movement to reduce the use of animal-based protein and replace it with plant-based protein.  This action is taken not only because of the rising awareness for animal welfare but also increasing the sustainability of our environment. Therefore, there are some people now trying to develop either meat or dairy substitutes. The alternatives would not only provide the same cooking experience but at the same time will also contain only plant-based materials, which can ultimately solve consumers’ concerns. In this paragraph, we’ll focus on egg alternatives, introduce existing egg alternatives products and discuss the science behind plant-based egg will be covered.</p>
	            <h2 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">What Can be Used as Egg Substitutes?</h2>
	            <p>Eggs are essential ingredients for food, especially for baking. Eggs leaven to help baked goods rise and provide structure to meringues. Besides, eggs could be whipped up into cream to be applied on a cake. Eggs are needed in everything from pancake to muffins. However, what can we do when we are serving a vegan guest? Or what can we used to replace eggs when we are halfway through preparing dinner and realize that there are no more eggs in the refrigerator?
    			<p>Applesauce and mashed bananas are the ones used as egg substitutes for baked good the most common since they are able to add moisture to baked goods but also work well as a binder. Other fruit purees such as mashed potato or avocado can also be used. Since fruit puree might add flavors, the sweet purees are recommended for cakes, and the less-sweet purees are more suitable for veggie burgers or salad dressings.</p>
				<p>Nuts or seeds are not just for salad toppings or smoothies. They are also excellent egg substitutes. For example, when nuts are ground into the paste, they can hold water and bind to other ingredients well. In terms of nutrition perspective, nuts also contain considerable healthy fats that could mimic the fat ingredient of eggs. As for seeds, they are also full of healthy fats as nuts are. Some special nuts such as flax seeds and chia seed can act like eggs when ground and combined with water into the thickened mixture. However, either nuts or seeds will give a nutty flavor to our finished dish so they are best used for some foods that possess enough strong flavors or odors such as some full-flavored nut butter cookies or flavored muffins. The mixture can also be used for savory meals, like meatballs, where the other flavors are strong enough to overpower that nuttiness. </p>

	            <p>What else is worthy of mentioning is the aquafaba. Aquafaba, the brine from legumes, is the perfect egg replacer as it is equipped with excellent foaming capability and it is also one of the cheapest and most accessible egg replacers around. The most popular aquafaba is from the leftover liquid from chickpeas cans. Aquafaba can be whipped into vegan mayonnaise, baked into meringues or macaroons, and shaken to make egg-free cocktail foams. What makes aquafaba different from other egg substitutes is that the residual bean flavor will disappear once it is cooked, so it can be used either for sweet or savory recipes.</p>

	            <p style="text-align:center">Fig. 2. Meringue pie made from aquafaba.</p>
	            <p>If a more fluffy texture is needed for specific cakes or loaves of bread, ingredients that can create chemical reaction to produced carbon dioxide are required. For instance, the combination of water, vegetable oil, and baking powder can leaven baked goods like cookies and cakes. However, this substitute might result in a very oily product if the recipe does not have a lot of egg yolks on the list. Therefore, another modified method has been brought out. The combination of baking soda and vinegar could give rise to the best leavening efficacy because of the carbon dioxide produced in two reactions. One is during the first reaction when vinegar is added and the other is during the second reaction while baking soda is heated in the oven.  </p>

	            <p>However, all of these substitutes have certain limitations. For example, many of the home-based egg substitutes provide only a single limited desired property of eggs in cooking, e.g., mashed fruit provides moisture and binding but not leavening, baking powder/soda and flour/water substitutes provide some leavening but limited binding properties. Therefore, some companies catch up with the trend and develop more practical and advanced egg substitutes.</p>

	            <p>Commercial egg replacers from Ener-G or Bob’s Red Mill have been released also for the usage of baked goods. Both products are in powder form with ingredients including tapioca flour, potato starch, and baking soda. We can find that the product description both claim that they are perfect substitutes for whole eggs in the recipes for cakes, waffles and pancakes that need a leavening agent to make them light and fluffy. For baked goods recipes, the egg replacer can act as a binder and add moisture for cookies, muffins and brownies. However, when looking at the reviews of the products, we can find feedbacks from consumers saying that those egg replacers are only suitable for certain types of baked goods. We’ve mentioned several egg replacers in previous paragraphs. However, applications of these egg substitutes are limited to bakery products. How about scrambled eggs, the simplest deliciousness that starts a new day for us? Is there any possible substitute for scrambled eggs? </p>

	            <p>VeganEgg manufactured by Follow Your Heart can be used for baking, scrambling, or anything else your imagination can come up with. People were very excited when Follow Your Heart just launched VeganEgg since VeganEgg is the first successful egg substitute that took the versatility of egg into consideration. Consumers can enjoy the versatility expected from eggs to bake cookies, muffins, cakes, and even cook up fluffy scrambled eggs and omelets. Although the development of VeganEgg is undoubtedly an extraordinarily intelligent idea, there are some drawbacks of VeganEgg. First of all, the preparation of egg substitute mixture is slightly inconvenient because it takes a longer time to make the mixture. VeganEgg calls for cold water to blend the mixture however the egg substitute made with iced water turns out to have a better texture than cold water. Furthermore, there is always some residual in the blender that is hard to get out.  Actually, Follow Your Heart just changed their recipe from algae protein isolate into soy protein powder. It is inevitable that the algae protein will lead to a fishy taste and smell, which is undesirable for the customers. Fortunately, the new recipe of the product that contains soy instead of algae might be milder or odorless.	</p>

	            <p style="text-align:center">Fig. 5 & 6. VeganEgg (left) and Just Egg (right)</p>

	            <p>Following up the launch of VeganEgg is Just Egg. Just Egg is a plant-based scrambled egg alternative from Just Inc. made with mung bean protein. Just Egg extends the versatility from VeganEgg and enhances the convenience for consumers to handle the product. The website of Just Egg underlines their product can not only be employed perfectly for scrambled egg but also french toast, waffle and fried rice. Indeed, Just Egg has brought a big success to the vegan egg market. Nevertheless, some improvements can still be made for the product. For example, it takes more than twice the time of cooking Just Egg than that takes to cook a chicken egg. Besides, the Just company should spend efforts on the technique to mask the flavor of mung bean isolate since the beany flavor is very obvious for consumers’ perception. The last goal that they could reach is to mature their manufacturing process to lower the cost and the price of Just Egg. When people who are not vegan saw the price of a bottle of Just Egg (USD 9.9/12oz), it is not surprising that they still maintain the same choice of chicken eggs. Although there are still some flaws that can be fixed for Just Egg, the science behind the development of this liquid egg substitute is still worth learning. Therefore, we will discuss what ingredients are in Just Egg and what are the purposes of the addition.</p>

	            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Science Behind Egg Alternatives</h2>

	            <p>To develop a successful vegan egg substitute, there are several things to consider for the selection of ingredients. The first thing to analyze is the composition of a chicken egg. Chicken eggs typically comprise around 10% protein content by weight. The high protein content of eggs plays a critical role in providing multi-functions such as gelling, binding, moisturizing, leavening, and emulsifying properties. Besides providing the qualities to egg substitute, the addition of protein also boosts the nutrition level of protein. While Just Egg takes mung bean isolate as their unique protein sources, some other available plant-based protein could be algae, rice, oat, potato, peanut, and any proteins derived from beans, lentils, and pulses. As for the oil, chicken eggs typically comprise about 11% oil/fat content by weight. The fat content of chicken eggs can provide a similar fat profile to that of chicken eggs and the desired moisture and texture to the egg-containing product. Although only canola oil is employed in Just Egg, other plant oil such as flaxseed oil, algae oil, sunflower oil and chia oil can be used as well.</p>
	            
	            <p>Besides protein and oil, the two major ingredients in the product, gums are also necessary for the invention of egg substitutes. Gum, or hydrocolloid, refers to materials that act as gelling or thickening agents, often comprising polysaccharides or glycoproteins. Gums can assist the gelation of protein when heated but at the same time hold water in the system. Gums not only improve the qualities of the final products also stabilize the emulsion system which presents a more desirable appearance of the product to customers and elongate the shelf life. Furthermore, gums can be used to partially replace fat and emulsifiers. The kind of gum that is used in Just Egg is gellan gum; however, the composition of other egg substitutes might comprise one or more gums, such as xanthan gum, Arabic gum, guar gum, locust bean gum, carrageenan gum or a combination of above. </p>
	            
	            <p>Basically, protein, oil, gum and water together account for more than 90 percent of the product. The rest of the ingredients are colorant, flavor and most importantly ions for stabilization of gelation of protein and gums. Among all, what will interact with protein and gum and affect ionic strength is salt. Salts can not only provide taste but also modify the aggregation of protein after the dissociation in water by the control of the charge and valency of protein. Usually, strength and range of electrostatic interactions of molecular decrease with increasing salt concentration. Addition of salt leads to neutralization of negative charge on protein surface with cation and consequently result in less repulsion of protein. The less electrostatic interaction is between protein molecule, the more possible that protein will aggregate. Salts are the critical ingredient in egg alternatives not only for the gelation of protein but they also decide the thickening and gelling capability of hydrocolloids. For instances, hydrocolloids such as alginate, carrageenan and gellan gum need the presence of cations to gel. Cations like potassium or calcium could bind the two double helical structures to facilitate the formation of a gel. As for thickening agents such as xanthan gum and other seed gum, salts also play an important role as salt bridges to trap water between hydrocolloid molecules. Some salts that present in egg replacers are calcium citrate and calcium lactate that could responsible for the gelling and thickening of the product. Moreover, gelling and thickening behavior is also affected by the pH of the solution. Chicken eggs can have a pH range of about 7-9, although the pH of eggs can vary widely with freshness or other environmental factors. However, plant proteins are slightly acidic or near neutral. Proteins probably are the most complex colloidal system in terms of variations in surface charge, surface chemistry, and size. Specifically, a protein could be positive-charged, neutral, or negative-charged at pH conditions below, near, and above its pI (Isoelectric point), respectively. Therefore, the company should be extraordinarily careful about the percentage of proteins and hydrocolloids. Based on the analysis of electrostatic interaction in the system, adjustment of pH by addition of acids and bases should be made to create a stable emulsion system which is able to coagulate when heated.</p>
	            
	            <p>Last things to elaborate are the flavor and color of the egg substitute, which directly influence whether consumers will purchase or repurchase the product by their perception. The most common natural colorants applied to mimic the yellowish and orange color of eggs are turmeric extract, annatto, paprika and β-carotene. While a single colorant compound or composition may be used, a combination of different colorants may also be used to achieve the desired final color. Flavor is always the top factor that impacts consumers’ decision of buying a product. Thus, how to mask the unpleasant plant protein flavor and create the eggy taste become the critical points for the product. Any suitable flavor additives may be used, salt and other seasonings, natural flavorings, yeast extracts. A special kind of salt is added not to the Just Egg but to the VeganEgg. The salt is called black salt or Kala Namak, which is high in sulfur content, enhancing the "eggy" flavor of the egg substitute composition. Some other ingredients that are rich in sulfur such as onion puree can be added if the function of the egg substitute is designed only for some savory foods.</p>

	            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Conclusion</h2>
	            <p>There are more and more egg substitutes launched targeting people who would like to avoid the usage of chicken eggs. Although those products have not been completely ideal to replace different function of chicken eggs and there is still improvement required for the taste and gelling properties, it is glad to know that people have started to be aware of the safety and health aspect of chicken eggs. We believe that a more well-developed egg substitute could be invented some day in the future. Subsequently, this will allow for a safer and healthier choice for eggs and simultaneously are also friendly to vegans and our environment.</p>
